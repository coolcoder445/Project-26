Hi! Myself Sunder Chawla .My Grade is 5th . I study in Apeejay School Model Town Jalandhar . I am Settle In Guru Nagar . It is a well maintained Colony. My Colony is clean and people are Friendly to each other . My Dream Is to Become world's Best Coder . I will make an app which will tell us that we can do everyThing . "Hardwork is The Key to Success" . 
My Second Dream Is to Become World's Best Youtuber . There is a story Of my Life . Before coding I was in chess . I left Chess Because I can't make interest in it . I was Playing A chess tournamet . My Match Was with Champion of Under 9 Catagery . I was Also In Under 9 But I was At the Second Place . The Champion Won the all matches . I also won all but it was my last match . First I was losing but then I made Draw We each Get 1/2 points . In the End Of the Tournamet He said me "Well Played" . Moral is - Winning is not everything We should hardwork and Try to Give the Best Performance . 
My Father Each and Every Day Told Me "Sunder Do Hardwork , Sunder Do Hardwork"
